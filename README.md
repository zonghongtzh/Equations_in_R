# Equations_in_R
Allows generic formula (single variable) to be plotted and tested for limits. 


Function allows input of any single variable function, and produces a graph and the Y-coordinate at its limits. 

function's restrictions:

- input mathematical function must be in the form of x, ie. f(x)

- maximum of tri-variate function
